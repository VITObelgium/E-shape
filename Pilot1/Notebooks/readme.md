**E-shape demo notebooks** 

1. **Emergence_detection_service.ipynb**

This notebook will showcase on how the user can retrieve emergence dates for the input fields.
In-situ data retrieved from CropObserve was used to calibrate the model. Note that this model is calibrated on only a limited set of fields. A more robust model that will be able to deal with estimating emergence of different crops across different regions will be available soon.

2. **Harvest_detection_service.ipynb**

This notebook will showcase on how the user can retrieve harvest dates for a field.
Note that the model used in this notebook is more suited for main crops only and it is especially trained on in-situ data from Belgium. Please use the notebook under section 3 in case you want to apply the harvest detection on a variety of crops (including cover crops) across different regions. 

3. **Harvest_detection_service_update_covercrops.ipynb**

Similar notebook as under section 2, but with a model trained on more in-situ data from CropObserve which includes cover crops harvest information.
