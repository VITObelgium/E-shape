    "### Disclaimer:\n",
    "Requesting in NRT (near real-time) is not recommended getting emergence dates.\n",
    "This is because the emergence date is searched by looking if a peak in backscatter happens after it or not. \n",
    "Therefore, one should consider a period of about 2 months after the actual emergence date to get a more robust result.\n",
    "Furthermore, one should take into account that this method is only based on radar signal so for some croptypes\n",
    "the result might be less good or during off-season it might be that falsely emergence is detected. \n",
